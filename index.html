							<h2>HELLO</h2>
							<p><strong>And that’s exactly what we want to convey to our core audience for this film. They too can build their credit and feel good about it. Credit isn’t just a number; it’s a weight off your shoulders. It’s a liberating step in the right direction. That’s exactly the emotion we should be getting from our unique—and quirky—Fingerhut characters.</strong></p>

							<p>Honestly, you had me at Chihuahua dumbbells. When we spoke on Zoom, we talked a lot about the spot having a certain energy to it. For me, that needs to come from both the performances as well as the edit and visuals of the spot itself. That's why we respond so positively to the ads that brands like Target create. There's a rhythm, an outlook, an upbeat vibe.</p>

							<h2>Tone & Approach</h2>
							<p><strong>Each scene we dive into needs to be brimming with personality. We’re not seeing a woman mow the lawn in boots as a joke. She’s doing it because that’s who she is—that’s her style. Or when we see our little girl ride her bike with a giant cape behind her, it’s not because her parents just gave her a cape to wear. It’s because she wanted one to own a moment on a suburban sidewalk. In her mind, she’s a model, and this is her runway. The thought being, put a different person in that scene, and you’d have a completely different moment.</strong></p>

								<p id="para2b">To that end, I want each scene to tell a story, no matter how small. We should be able to decipher what the narrative is in one, two, or three shots at the very most. It’s a setup and payoff. For instance, our kitchen couple is having a little contest to see who can work faster. They race around the kitchen, one repairing a cabinet with a drill, the other mixing cake batter. As soon as he puts the mixer in the batter, the batter flies everywhere and they come together, laughing, to give us that slow-motion moment. That’s a two-shot scene in my mind—and it’s full of fun and idiosyncrasy showing us who these people are.</p>

							<h2>Energy & Slow Motion</h2>
							<p></p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>I come from a music video and choreography background. I love capturing a distinctive rhythm on camera. In fact, one of my greatest passions is casting former dancers and letting them have fun. There’s so much joy in seeing someone let loose after their energy has been bundled up for so long.</p>

							<!-- Section -->
								<section>
									<header>
										<p><strong>Creating a rhythm and then breaking it up can also be immensely rewarding. That’s what our slow motion will give us. I picture us ramping to slow motion at the exact moment our characters reach their peak confidence. While this could be a burst of dance-inspired movement (during the lawnmower scene), it could just as easily be someone standing powerfully like a superhero (during our grill scene).</strong></p>
										<p><b>Let's make sure we're motivating the slow motion with both big and small moments to really highlight both the product and the eye-catching technique.</b></p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<div class="gallery">
											<a href="images/gallery/fulls/4.jpg" class="landscape"><img id="mowerthumb" src="images/gallery/thumbs/4-thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											
											<video muted=true class="image main" id="headbob" autoplay loop><source src="images/mp4/4.mp4"></video>
											<p>But from there, we should then break back into the faster-paced energy of the spot before moving to the next scene. And as we transition, we match the characters’ action between scenes so the rhythm flows into the next moment. For instance, the woman behind the lawnmower does a spin move at the end of her scene. As she twirls, we cut to our guy in the kitchen spinning around his wife. The visual of both characters circling around syncs up to the next scene while maintaining the vibrancy we’ve already established.</p>

							<h2>Casting</h2>
							<p><strong>It gets said ad nauseam, but that doesn’t make it any less true: Casting is the most important thing here. While we certainly need people with interesting and diverse looks, we also need people who can make us smile without even seeming to try. For our lawnmower, kitchen couple, laptop teen, and workout woman, I’d love to cast former dancers. Not because we’ll be giving them proper choreography, but rather because they’ll know how to move and express themselves. They’ll naturally radiate happiness. We want that extra bit of flare to their scenes that a dance background will give us. They do something a little bit impressive or do something on the beat and it makes our smile that much bigger.</strong></p>

								<p id="para2b">That said, while we can prescribe what we want these people to do, let’s also allow them to show their true personalities during the audition. If someone can, say, do the worm while pushing a mower, let’s not be afraid to incorporate that. In other words, let’s be open to what the talent can bring, too. It’ll make the result that much more natural.</p>

									<h3>None of the below is set in stone, but here's how I see the casting so far:</h3>
									<p><strong>Lawnmower Woman: 50s/60s. African American. It would be fun to have someone with long graying hair or long braids who can whip their hair around (like a lawnmower) as they dance through the yard.</strong></p>
									<p><strong>Biker Girl: 8 to 10 years old. Hispanic. She’s not afraid to own the room. She’s bossy and serious about it in the best way. She rides her bike down the sidewalk because she wants the attention.</strong></p>
									<p><strong>Kitchen Man: 50s. Asian. I think he should have a hipster/cowboy-inspired look. He’s a rugged hands-on guy who really embraces Americana.</strong></p>
									<p><strong>Kitchen Woman: 50s. Hispanic. Short hair, tattoos. Her wardrobe has a retro Rosie the Riveter flare to it. She’s into a ‘50s-inspired pinup culture.</strong></p>

									<p><strong>Computer Teenager: 13 to 16 years old. Caucasian or Hispanic. He’s tall and skinny or a bit bigger. Either way, he still has some acne. He’s awkward but that doesn’t make him any less afraid to show his personality online.</strong></p>
									<p><strong>Workout Woman: 30s/early 40s. Indian/Southeast Asian. She’s average-looking and is only just just getting into her workout routine.</strong></p>
									<p><strong>BBQ Man: 40s. Caucasian or African American. He’s a bigger guy who embraces what he did when he was younger. It would be great to find a drummer—someone who can twirl a BBQ tool around his finger like a drumstick.</strong></p>

							<h2>CINEMATOGRAPHY</h2>
							<p><strong>To capture the energy of these spots while still making the people feel real, I want to embrace a controlled handheld look. That means shots can dramatically push into a scene, but with a loose sense of camerawork to them. We’re not just capturing the action; we’re adding to it. Each moment will have a visual panache. This isn’t a documentary camera that’s just a fly on the wall. It’s right there with our actors, enhancing the rush of each frame.</strong></p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<span class="image main"><video muted=true autoplay loop>
								<source src="images/mp4/8.mp4">
							</video></span>
							<p>We should also embrace a shallow depth of field when we’re close to our characters. This will make some of the smaller products look great (the sunglasses and boots, for example)—they’ll pop. But it will also give the spot a cinematic aesthetic that makes us feel like we’re right next to real people in real homes.</p>
							<p>In terms of lighting, I’m always attached to a sunlit look. It’s bright and beautiful without feeling too overlit. <a target="_blank" href="https://wdrv.it/present-project-detail/assetId/91956313/token/10a3263f8/presentationId/15447042">My work for the BBC is a good example of this.</a> The world we're living in is elevated and inviting - but it could just as easily be a real location, and that's due to how it's lit.</p>

							<h2>LOCATION & ART DIRECTION</h2>
							<h3><strong>Just because you're still working on your credit doesn't mean you can't have style!</strong></h3>
							<p><strong>We’re after a single location that can give us a variety of different—and colorful—looks. We want to strike a balance with a real house that feels both grounded and slightly aspirational. For this, our best option is an older house that’s been a bit updated. The kitchen is new, but the beautiful wood floors are original. The backyard deck is newly constructed, but there’s a distinct character to the older American Craftsman house just behind it. Our current plan is to shoot this in Chicago, and there’s no doubt in my mind that we’ll find plenty of true-to-life location options there.</strong></p>

								<p id="para6">After casting, art direction is my second greatest love, and I want to make sure we nail it. We’ll find a good house that will serve as our base, and then dress and paint the walls to finish a specific look. There’s a subtle but coherent style to each environment. As with the images on this page, you can tell each scene has been subtly art-directed. But they’re not done in a way that’s glaring or unrealistic. We think about wall color in relation to wardrobe and negative space.</p>

							<h2>THE PRODUCTS</h2>
							<p><strong>As we discussed on the call, Fingerhut’s main marketing point is to highlight the help it provides in building credit. And as I mentioned before, I think that will certainly come across in how our cast members perform in their respective scenes—you notice it just in their eyes, but also in their physicality. But just as importantly, we want the product to come off as lovingly lit and integrated into the scene. At all times, let’s think about the colors and appearance of the product in relation to our location. I’m not for environments where the color of the drill matches the walls—but I do think color plays a big role in making a product standout. So let’s make sure our products look their absolute best by seamlessly weaving them into the production design of each set.</strong></p>

Just behind it—and slightly out of focus—we see someone dancing behind the mower. We cut to a handheld shot of our Lawnmower Woman as she whips her long hair around like helicopter blades. Aside from her Timberland boots, she’s dressed more for a summer party than for yard work. But then—we notice she has headphones on. She’s clearly rocking out, confident and carefree. Her hair slides across the lens, almost touching us.</b></p>
									<h3>VO: At Fingerhut, we don’t define you by your credit score.</h3>
